Section 3: A Comparative Analysis of Continuous Distributions for the Positive ComponentThe choice of the conditional distribution for the positive values, f(y|y>0), is a critical step in building a two-part model. The distribution must be defined on the positive real line and should be flexible enough to capture the features of the data, which, in the case of phenomena like precipitation, often include significant right-skewness and heavy tails. This section provides a detailed comparison of several common and advanced distributional choices.3.1. Standard Parametric ChoicesThree distributions—Gamma, Lognormal, and Weibull—are workhorses in the modeling of non-negative, skewed data.3.1.1. The Gamma Distribution (Γ)The Gamma distribution is a flexible two-parameter family widely used for modeling continuous, strictly positive variables such as waiting times or rainfall amounts.23Properties: It is typically parameterized by a shape parameter \alpha > 0 and either a scale parameter \theta > 0 or a rate parameter \lambda = 1/\theta.25 Its PDF is given by:f(y;α,θ)=θαΓ(α)yα−1e−y/θ​for y>0where \Gamma(\alpha) is the Gamma function. The mean and variance are E = \alpha\theta and Var(Y) = \alpha\theta^2, respectively. A key property is that its skewness, given by 2/\sqrt{\alpha}, depends solely on the shape parameter.25 As \alpha increases, the distribution becomes more symmetric, approaching a Normal distribution for large \alpha. For \alpha \le 1, the PDF is J-shaped or strictly decreasing, while for \alpha > 1, it is unimodal and mound-shaped.27 The Gamma distribution is a member of the Tweedie family of distributions with power parameter p=2.28Suitability: Its inherent flexibility and non-negative support make it a natural first choice for modeling precipitation amounts, and it is frequently used as a baseline model in hydrological and climatological studies.293.1.2. The Lognormal Distribution (LN)The Lognormal distribution is another two-parameter distribution that is fundamental for modeling right-skewed data.Properties: A random variable Y is said to follow a Lognormal distribution if its natural logarithm, \log(Y), follows a Normal distribution.31 It arises theoretically from processes involving the product of many independent random variables, making it suitable for phenomena where effects are multiplicative rather than additive.33 The distribution is defined by the parameters of the underlying normal distribution on the log scale: the location \mu (mean of \log(Y)) and the scale \sigma (standard deviation of \log(Y)). Its PDF is:f(y;μ,σ)=yσ2π​1​exp(−2σ2(logy−μ)2​)for y>0The Lognormal distribution is always positively skewed, and both its skewness and kurtosis are increasing functions of \sigma, meaning it can exhibit very heavy right tails.32Suitability: It is a common choice in economics (e.g., income), finance (e.g., stock prices), and geostatistics (e.g., ore grades).32 It has also been successfully applied to precipitation data, often performing well in goodness-of-fit tests.243.1.3. The Weibull Distribution (W)The Weibull distribution is exceptionally versatile and is a cornerstone of reliability engineering and survival analysis.Properties: It is a two-parameter distribution with a shape parameter k > 0 (also denoted \beta) and a scale parameter \lambda > 0 (also denoted \eta).35 Its PDF is:f(y;k,λ)=λk​(λy​)k−1exp(−(λy​)k)for y>0The shape of the Weibull distribution changes dramatically with the value of k.35 For k < 1, the PDF is J-shaped, corresponding to a decreasing failure rate (e.g., infant mortality). For k = 1, it reduces to the Exponential distribution, which has a constant failure rate. For k > 1, the distribution is unimodal and mound-shaped, corresponding to an increasing failure rate (e.g., wear-out failures). This flexibility allows it to model both right-skewed data (for 1 < k < 3.6) and even left-skewed data (for k > 3.6), a feature not shared by the Gamma or Lognormal distributions.37Suitability: While its primary application is modeling time-to-failure, its flexibility makes it a plausible candidate for other skewed data types. Several studies have successfully applied a zero-inflated Weibull model to rainfall data, leveraging its adaptability to capture the distribution of wet-day amounts.303.2. A Comparative Framework for Standard DistributionsWhen choosing among these three standard distributions for a specific application like precipitation, it becomes apparent that there is no universally superior choice. The literature presents a complex and sometimes seemingly contradictory picture, which reveals a deeper principle: the optimal distribution is context-dependent and tied to the specific goals of the analysis.For instance, one study comparing models for daily precipitation found that the Lognormal distribution provided the best statistical fit based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), but its stochastic simulations tended to overestimate monthly mean and maximum precipitation values. In contrast, the Gamma distribution, despite having a worse statistical fit (higher BIC), performed very well in reproducing the observed monthly mean precipitation in simulations.24 Another comprehensive study found that for wet-day precipitation in the United States, the Pearson Type-III distribution (a three-parameter generalization of the Gamma) and the four-parameter Kappa distribution generally provided a better fit than the standard Gamma distribution.29 Meanwhile, other analyses have shown the Lognormal to have a slight advantage based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 41, and another approach suggests discriminating between Lognormal and Weibull based on the symmetry of the log-transformed data—it is symmetric for Lognormal but skewed for Weibull.42This lack of a single winner underscores the importance of the fit-versus-simulation tradeoff. A model that provides the best goodness-of-fit to the observed data may not be the best for generating realistic simulations or for making predictions about specific aspects of the distribution, such as the mean or the extreme tails. A researcher's choice must therefore be guided by the primary objective of their study.If the goal is to accurately model the central tendency or total volume (e.g., for water budget analysis or agricultural planning), a distribution like Gamma that accurately reproduces the mean may be preferable, even if its fit statistic is not the absolute best.24If the goal is to analyze and predict rare, extreme events (e.g., for flood risk assessment or infrastructure design), a distribution with heavier tails, such as the Lognormal or a specialized extreme value distribution like the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD), may be necessary. These distributions are better able to capture the low-probability, high-magnitude events that drive risk, which other distributions might underestimate.29To aid practitioners in this selection process, the following table summarizes the key properties of these three standard distributions.PropertyGamma DistributionLognormal DistributionWeibull DistributionPDF Formula$f(y) = \frac{y^{\alpha-1} e^{-y/\theta}}{\theta^\alpha \Gamma(\alpha)}$$f(y) = \frac{1}{y \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\log y - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$f(y) = \frac{k}{\lambda} \left(\frac{y}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1} \exp\left(-\left(\frac{y}{\lambda}\right)^k\right)$ParametersShape $\alpha$, Scale $\theta$Log-Location $\mu$, Log-Scale $\sigma$Shape $k$, Scale $\lambda$Mean$\alpha\theta$$\exp(\mu + \sigma^2/2)$$\lambda \Gamma(1 + 1/k)$Variance$\alpha\theta^2$$(\exp(\sigma^2) - 1) \exp(2\mu + \sigma^2)$$\lambda^2 [\Gamma(1 + 2/k) - (\Gamma(1 + 1/k))^2]$Skewness$2/\sqrt{\alpha}$ (Depends only on shape)$(\exp(\sigma^2) + 2)\sqrt{\exp(\sigma^2) - 1}$Complex function of $k$; can be positive or negative.Key FeaturesFlexible, always right-skewed.

Also used for rainfall. 303.3. Advanced and Flexible DistributionsWhen standard three-parameter distributions are insufficient to capture the complexity of the data, more flexible systems are available.3.3.1. The Johnson System of DistributionsThe Johnson system is a highly adaptable family of four-parameter distributions developed by Norman L. Johnson in 1949.44 The system's core principle is the transformation of a standard normal random variate Z into a random variable Y that can match the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) of an observed dataset. The general transformation is:Z=γ+δ⋅g(λY−ξ​)where \xi is a location parameter, \lambda is a scale parameter, and \gamma and \delta are shape parameters. The function g(.) defines the specific family within the system 44:S_L Family (Lognormal): g(x) = \log(x). This is the lognormal distribution.S_B Family (Bounded): g(x) = \log(x / (1-x)). This family generates distributions bounded on an interval (\xi, \xi+\lambda).S_U Family (Unbounded): g(x) = \text{arsinh}(x) = \log(x + \sqrt{x^2+1}). This family generates distributions that are unbounded on the real line.For modeling precipitation, which is bounded below by zero but can be considered practically unbounded above, the Johnson S_U distribution is a particularly powerful candidate.46 Its ability to model a wide range of skewness and kurtosis values makes it suitable for data with heavy tails where extreme events are more frequent than predicted by a normal or gamma distribution.47 The Johnson S_B distribution has also been successfully applied in a related context: modeling the size distribution of raindrops, which is naturally bounded.49 The primary advantage of the Johnson system is its data-driven flexibility; it offers a robust solution when the underlying distributional form is unknown or when standard distributions provide a poor fit.443.3.2. Other Modern Approaches for PrecipitationRecent research has focused on developing models that are specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of precipitation data.Tweedie Distributions: The Tweedie family of distributions is a subclass of exponential dispersion models characterized by a power variance function V(\mu) = \phi \mu^p.28 This family unifies several well-known distributions, including the Normal (p=0), Poisson (p=1), Gamma (p=2), and Inverse Gaussian (p=3). The most interesting case for semicontinuous data is when 1 < p < 2. In this range, the Tweedie distribution behaves as a compound Poisson-Gamma distribution. It is a mixed discrete-continuous distribution that has a positive probability mass at zero and a continuous, Gamma-like distribution for positive values. This makes the Tweedie distribution a natural, integrated one-part model for zero-inflated continuous data, providing an elegant alternative to the two-part modeling framework.28Zero-Inflated Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (ZIEGPD): This is a state-of-the-art model proposed specifically for analyzing daily rainfall data.2 Traditional extreme value analysis for precipitation often relies on the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to model exceedances above a high, and often arbitrarily chosen, threshold. The ZIEGPD overcomes this limitation by unifying the modeling of dry days (the zero inflation), the bulk of the wet-day distribution, and the extreme tail within a single, coherent framework.50 It extends the GPD to a zero-inflated structure, intrinsically capturing the tail behavior without the need for threshold selection. This model represents a significant advancement in the statistical analysis of precipitation, providing a more holistic and robust approach to understanding the full spectrum of rainfall events.3
