Temporally Coherent Parameter Generation in Non-Autoregressive Probabilistic ForecastingSection 1: The Challenge of Temporal Coherence in Direct Multi-Horizon ForecastingNon-autoregressive, or direct, multi-horizon forecasting models have emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering significant inference speed advantages over their sequential, autoregressive counterparts by predicting the entire forecast horizon in a single forward pass.1 This is particularly valuable in operational settings where low-latency predictions are critical. In the context of probabilistic forecasting, these models do not merely predict a point estimate for each future timestep; instead, they directly output the parameters of a full conditional probability distribution for each point in the horizon. This approach allows for a rich characterization of uncertainty, which is indispensable for risk management and decision-making in fields such as finance, energy, and supply chain management.3However, the parallel generation mechanism that grants these models their speed also introduces a fundamental challenge: ensuring the temporal coherence of the predicted distribution parameters. While each set of parameters at a given timestep, θt​, might yield a high likelihood for the corresponding observation, the resulting sequence of parameters across the horizon, Θ=(θ1​,θ2​,...,θH​), can exhibit erratic, physically implausible behavior. This report provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art analysis of architectural patterns and advanced regularization techniques designed to address this critical issue, ensuring that non-autoregressive models can produce parameter trajectories that are not only accurate but also temporally consistent and physically meaningful.1.1. The Parameter Trajectory Problem: A Dynamical Systems PerspectiveIn a non-autoregressive probabilistic forecasting framework, the model learns a mapping from a context, Xcontext​ (comprising historical target values, covariates, and static features), to a sequence of parameter vectors, Θ. The core objective is to model the conditional probability p(Θ∣Xcontext​). Each vector θt​ parameterizes a chosen distribution, such as the Student-T, Generalized Pareto, or, as specified in the problem statement, the Spliced Binned-Pareto (SBP) distribution.The SBP distribution is particularly well-suited for time series with heavy-tailed noise, a common feature in many real-world applications.5 It achieves robustness and flexibility by combining a discrete binned distribution for the body of the data with two Generalized Pareto Distributions (GPDs) for the upper and lower tails.5 A single neural network is used to parameterize all components, allowing the model to capture time dependencies in both the central tendency and the extreme values of the distribution.5Within this framework, the tail shape parameter, ξ (often denoted xi), is of paramount importance. It is a key parameter of the GPDs that governs the heaviness of the tails:ξ>0: The tail is heavy and unbounded (Fréchet-like), characteristic of high-risk financial returns or extreme weather events.ξ=0: The tail is moderately heavy (Gumbel-like).ξ<0: The tail is light and has a finite upper bound (Weibull-like), which could model phenomena with physical limits, such as component failure rates.Accurately modeling the evolution of ξ over the forecast horizon is crucial for applications like anomaly detection and risk assessment, as it directly quantifies the probability of extreme events.5 A smooth, monotonic increase in ξt​ over time could signify a period of escalating risk, providing a clear, actionable insight. Conversely, a sequence where ξt​ oscillates wildly between positive and negative values from one timestep to the next is often physically nonsensical and undermines the credibility of the forecast.This challenge can be framed as the "parameter trajectory problem." The sequence of parameters, and specifically the scalar sequence (ξ1​,ξ2​,...,ξH​), can be viewed as a discrete realization of an underlying, continuous latent process, ξ(t). The objective of advanced regularization and architectural design is to impose a physically plausible prior on this latent process—most commonly, a smoothness prior. The model must learn not just to predict a set of parameters, but to generate a smooth and credible trajectory through the parameter space.1.2. Pathologies of Naive Regularization: A Critical AnalysisThe most straightforward approaches to enforcing smoothness involve adding penalty terms to the model's loss function. However, these simple methods often fail, either by introducing new artifacts or by excessively constraining the model's expressive power.A fundamental reason for this failure lies in the nature of non-autoregressive models. Autoregressive models, such as DeepAR, inherently possess a temporal structure in their generation process.8 The prediction at timestep t is conditioned on a hidden state that is a function of the prediction at t−1. This creates an implicit Markovian-like dependency chain on the generated parameters, naturally encouraging local consistency. Non-autoregressive models, by design, break this sequential dependency to enable parallel computation.2 They generate all H parameter sets simultaneously from a single, global context vector. Consequently, there is no inherent architectural link between the generation of θt​ and θt−1​. Any temporal relationship must be imposed externally, typically through the loss function. If the loss is merely a sum of the negative log-likelihoods at each point, L=∑t=1H​NLL(yt​∣θt​), the model is incentivized to optimize each timestep independently, leading to incoherent parameter sequences. This "curse of non-autoregression" for parameter plausibility motivates the search for more sophisticated solutions that can re-introduce temporal consistency without sacrificing parallelism.Difference Penalties (L1​/L2​ on Δξt​)A common technique, borrowed from time series decomposition methods like the Hodrick-Prescott filter, is to penalize the first or second differences of the parameter sequence.10 For instance, an L2​ penalty on the first difference would be:Ldiff​=λt=2∑H​∣∣ξt​−ξt−1​∣∣22​While this penalty effectively prevents sharp, single-step jumps, it suffers from a critical flaw: it is a purely local constraint. The model learns to minimize the difference between adjacent points without any global understanding of what a plausible trajectory looks like. This often leads to the generation of "lazy" solutions that satisfy the penalty term but are physically unrealistic. For example, the model might produce a smooth but nonsensical sigmoid-shaped ramp or a completely flat line for the ξ sequence, as these shapes have very low first-difference penalties. These artifacts arise because the model is only incentivized to be smooth locally, not to be plausible globally.Magnitude Penalties (L1​/L2​ on ξt​)Another common regularization strategy is to penalize the magnitude of the parameters themselves, a technique known as Ridge (L2​) or Lasso (L1​) regression.11 The loss term takes the form:Lmag​=λt=1∑H​∣∣ξt​∣∣22​In a Bayesian framework, this is equivalent to placing a zero-mean Gaussian prior on the parameter ξ.12 For the tail shape parameter, where ξ=0 corresponds to a moderately-tailed Gumbel-like distribution, this penalty aggressively shrinks the model's predictions toward this neutral value. This fundamentally undermines the motivation for using a flexible, heavy-tailed distribution like the SBP in the first place. The model is actively discouraged from predicting the very heavy-tailed (ξ>0) or bounded-tailed (ξ<0) phenomena it was designed to capture.5 This type of regularization effectively "neuters" the model, preventing it from learning the complex tail dynamics present in the data. The inadequacy of these naive approaches necessitates the exploration of more advanced architectural patterns and regularization schemes that can impose meaningful temporal structure without introducing undesirable side effects.Section 2: Architectural Patterns for Generating Smooth Parameter SequencesTo overcome the limitations of simple regularization, a more principled approach is to embed the generation of temporally consistent parameter sequences directly into the model's architecture. This section surveys several state-of-the-art architectural patterns that achieve this, ranging from hybrid models that re-introduce local sequentiality to continuous-time frameworks where smoothness is a fundamental property. These architectures can be conceptualized along a spectrum, from those that implicitly encourage smoothness through their structure to those that explicitly enforce it through their mathematical formulation.2.1. Sequential Parameter Heads: Re-introducing Autoregression LocallyA compelling hybrid approach involves a two-stage generation process. First, a powerful non-autoregressive encoder (e.g., a Transformer) processes the entire input context to produce a single, fixed-size context vector, C. This vector encapsulates all necessary information for the forecast. Second, this context vector seeds a smaller, efficient sequential decoder, or "parameter head," which then unrolls the sequence of distribution parameters (θ1​,θ2​,...,θH​). This design retains the bulk of the parallel processing in the encoder while re-introducing a controlled, local form of autoregression at the final generation stage to ensure temporal coherence.Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) as Parameter DecodersTemporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) offer an excellent balance between expressive power and computational efficiency for this task.13 A TCN-based parameter head would take the context vector C, replicated H times along the temporal dimension, as its input. The core of the TCN consists of a stack of 1D convolutional layers characterized by two key properties:Causality: The convolutions are causal, meaning the output at timestep t can only depend on inputs at or before t. This is achieved through left-padding the input sequence.14Dilation: The convolutions are dilated, with the dilation factor increasing exponentially with the depth of the network (e.g., d=2l for layer l). This allows the receptive field of the network to grow exponentially, enabling it to capture very long-range dependencies with a relatively small number of layers.13The combination of a large receptive field and the shared convolutional kernels inherently promotes smoothness. The parameter vector θt​ is computed as a smooth, non-linear function of the global context C and the preceding inputs, effectively making the entire parameter trajectory a smooth transformation of the context. TCNs avoid the sequential computation bottleneck of RNNs, as convolutions can be processed in parallel, making them a highly efficient and effective choice for a parameter head.14Recurrent Parameter Generators (RNN/GRU/LSTM)A more direct way to enforce sequential dependency is to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or its more advanced variants, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), as the parameter head.9 In this configuration, the context vector C is used to initialize the hidden state, h0​, of the recurrent cell. The cell is then unrolled for H steps. At each step t, the hidden state is updated, ht​=GRU(ht−1​,inputt​), and the output is passed through a linear layer to produce the parameter vector θt​. The input at each step, inputt​, could be a zero vector, a learned embedding for that timestep, or even the parameter vector from the previous step, θt−1​.This architecture explicitly models the conditional dependency p(θt​∣θt−1​,...,θ1​,C), providing the strongest form of step-by-step temporal linkage among the hybrid approaches. While this sequential unrolling is computationally slower than a TCN, the parameter generation phase is often not the main bottleneck in a large forecasting model. The concept of using a recurrent generator to produce structured outputs from a compact latent representation has been explored in various domains and remains a robust pattern for ensuring sequence coherence.32.2. Continuous-Time Models: Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) offer what is arguably the most elegant and mathematically principled solution to the parameter trajectory problem. Instead of modeling dynamics in discrete steps, NCDEs operate in continuous time, where smoothness is not an add-on regularizer but a fundamental property of the model class itself.19Modeling Parameter Dynamics as a Continuous FlowAn NCDE models the evolution of a latent hidden state, z(t), as the solution to a differential equation that is controlled by a continuous input path, X(t).20 The governing equation is:dz(t)=f(z(t);θf​)dX(t)Here, f is a neural network parameterized by θf​, and X(t) is a continuous path created by interpolating the outputs of an encoder that has processed the input time series. The model learns the vector field f that describes how the latent state z(t) should evolve in response to the driving signal X(t).To generate a forecast, the initial state z(T) is determined from the historical context. Then, this differential equation is solved numerically over the forecast interval $$ using a black-box ODE solver. The result is a continuous, inherently smooth trajectory of the latent state, z(t), for t∈. The distribution parameters for any future time t are then obtained by a simple decoding function, typically a linear layer, applied to the latent state: θt​=g(z(t)).23The profound advantage of this approach is that smoothness is guaranteed by the fundamental theorem of calculus. By learning the derivative of the latent process, the model must produce a continuous integral path. This provides a powerful inductive bias for generating smooth parameter trajectories and is particularly well-suited for handling irregularly sampled time series, a common challenge where discrete-step models falter.19Extensions to Probabilistic ForecastingThe NCDE framework naturally extends to probabilistic forecasting. The decoded output from the continuous latent trajectory, θt​=g(z(t)), can directly represent the full set of parameters for any chosen distribution, including the SBP.23 The entire model, from the encoder that produces the control path X(t) to the vector field network f and the decoder g, can be trained end-to-end by maximizing the log-likelihood of the observed data under the continuously evolving predicted distributions. While more advanced variants like Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDEs) model uncertainty directly within the latent dynamics, the deterministic NCDE-to-distribution-parameter approach is a direct and powerful method for this specific problem.192.3. Generative Models: Diffusion and Score-Based ApproachesDeep generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have achieved state-of-the-art results in generating high-fidelity data in various domains.25 Their application to time series forecasting offers a powerful, non-autoregressive alternative for modeling complex, multivariate distributions over future trajectories.Non-Autoregressive Diffusion (e.g., TimeDiff)In a diffusion model for forecasting, the entire future window of the time series, Y1:H​, is treated as a single data point. The model is trained to reverse a diffusion process where Gaussian noise is gradually added to this future window. The reverse (denoising) process is conditioned on the historical context, Y−L:0​.27 The entire forecast is generated jointly, which implicitly encourages temporal consistency, as the denoising network (often a U-Net or Transformer) operates on the full sequence at each denoising step.27The temporal quality of the final generated sample, however, is highly dependent on the efficacy of the conditioning mechanism. The TimeDiff model, for instance, introduces two novel conditioning mechanisms tailored for time series to improve coherence 27:Autoregressive Initialization: A simple linear autoregressive model is used to generate a crude but temporally smooth "first guess" of the forecast trajectory. This initial guess is provided as an additional conditioning signal to the denoising network, helping to anchor the diffusion process with a plausible temporal structure.Future Mixup: During training, this mechanism, analogous to teacher forcing, creates a conditioning signal by blending the encoded past information with a randomly selected subset of the ground-truth future values. This forces the model to learn the relationships between past and future segments and to generate plausible transitions, significantly improving the quality of the final forecast.27Imposing Temporal Structure in the Denoising Process (e.g., ARTDiff)An alternative strategy is to embed the temporal consistency assumption directly into the diffusion process itself, rather than relying solely on the conditioning network. The ARTDiff model, for example, proposes modifying the standard DDPM framework by using a correlated Gaussian noise distribution in the forward process.30 The covariance matrix of the noise added at each step is structured such that the noise at timestep t is correlated with the noise at timestep t−1, with the correlation decaying as a function of their temporal distance. This means the model learns to denoise a signal that is temporally structured from the very beginning. By baking the smoothness prior directly into the generative process, this approach can lead to more robustly consistent and realistic samples without introducing significant computational overhead.302.4. Comparative Analysis of Architectural PatternsThe choice of architecture involves a trade-off between computational efficiency, implementation complexity, and the strength of the imposed smoothness prior. A Conditional Neural Process (CNP) framework offers a valuable theoretical lens for this problem, reframing it as learning a distribution over functions, where the function is the parameter trajectory itself, t↦θt​.31 Architectures like ConvCNP, which use convolutional backbones, are naturally suited to producing smooth function realizations and directly address the core challenge.33 The table below summarizes the primary architectural patterns discussed.ArchitectureCore Mechanism for SmoothnessAdvantagesDisadvantagesBest Suited ForRelevant SnippetsTCN Parameter HeadCausal, dilated convolutions create a large, smooth receptive field over the context.Computationally efficient; parallelizable; strong empirical performance for sequences.Indirect control over smoothness; may require careful tuning of dilation/kernels.Scenarios requiring high performance and efficiency where implicit smoothness is sufficient.13RNN Parameter HeadExplicit sequential state passing (ht​ depends on ht−1​).Direct and intuitive modeling of temporal dependency.Prone to vanishing/exploding gradients; slower due to sequential computation.Problems with strong, short-range temporal dependencies where explicit state is beneficial.3Neural CDELearns the continuous-time derivative of the latent state, ensuring a continuous solution path.Inherently smooth trajectories; principled handling of irregular data; strong theoretical grounding.Computationally more intensive; newer and less-established in mainstream forecasting libraries.Irregularly sampled time series; when the underlying process has known physical (continuous) dynamics.19Diffusion ModelsJoint generation of the entire sequence, with smoothness enforced by conditioning and denoising architecture.State-of-the-art generative quality; flexible conditioning; can model complex distributions.Slow inference (iterative sampling); consistency depends heavily on the quality of conditioning.Applications where capturing the full, complex data distribution is critical and inference speed is not a primary constraint.25Section 3: Advanced Regularization for Plausible Parameter EvolutionBeyond architectural choices, the loss function provides a powerful and often complementary mechanism for shaping the characteristics of the generated parameter trajectories. Advanced regularization techniques allow for the injection of strong, domain-specific prior beliefs about the data-generating process into a flexible neural network model. A jerk penalty, for instance, imposes a prior belief that the underlying dynamics are physically smooth, while an Optimal Transport loss imposes a prior that probability distributions evolve efficiently. This elevates regularization from a mere tool for preventing overfitting to a core component of probabilistic model specification.3.1. Physics-Informed Regularization: Penalizing Higher-Order DerivativesInspiration from physics and robotics offers a potent class of regularizers for enforcing smoothness. In these fields, planning smooth trajectories for physical systems is a central problem, and the concept of minimizing higher-order derivatives of motion is well-established.35Jerk PenaltyIn kinematics, "jerk" is the third derivative of position with respect to time—the rate of change of acceleration. A trajectory that minimizes the integral of the squared jerk is considered maximally smooth, as it avoids abrupt changes in acceleration, which are often inefficient or physically jarring.35 This principle can be directly applied to the parameter trajectory problem by treating the parameter of interest, ξ, as a "position" that evolves over the discrete time of the forecast horizon.The jerk can be approximated using finite differences. The first derivative (velocity) at time t is ξ˙​t​≈ξt+1​−ξt​. The second derivative (acceleration) is ξ¨​t​≈ξ˙​t​−ξ˙​t−1​≈(ξt+1​−ξt​)−(ξt​−ξt−1​)=ξt+1​−2ξt​+ξt−1​. The third derivative (jerk) is then the difference of accelerations:$$\dddot{\xi}_t \approx \ddot{\xi}_{t+1} - \ddot{\xi}_t \approx (\xi_{t+2} - 2\xi_{t+1} + \xi_t) - (\xi_{t+1} - 2\xi_t + \xi_{t-1}) = \xi_{t+2} - 3\xi_{t+1} + 3\xi_t - \xi_{t-1}
$$A jerk penalty loss term would then be the sum of the squared jerk over the horizon:$$
\mathcal{L}_{jerk} = \lambda_{jerk} \sum_{t=2}^{H-2} (\xi_{t+2} - 3\xi_{t+1} + 3\xi_t - \xi_{t-1})^2$$This penalty is superior to a simple first- or second-difference penalty because it penalizes changes in curvature. A trajectory with constant, non-zero acceleration (a parabola) has zero jerk and would not be penalized, whereas a first-difference penalty would be high. This allows the model to learn smooth but dynamic trends in the parameter, while strongly discouraging the unrealistic sigmoid-like artifacts that arise from simple difference penalties, which are characterized by high jerk at the start and end of the ramp.393.2. Distributional Consistency via Optimal Transport (OT)Optimal Transport (OT) theory provides a powerful mathematical framework for comparing probability distributions by measuring the "Wasserstein distance" between them. This distance represents the minimum "work" or "cost" required to transform the probability mass of one distribution into the other.40 This is conceptually appealing for regularizing parameter trajectories, as it encourages the predicted distribution to evolve in a "low-effort" or physically efficient manner over time.Sinkhorn Divergence as a RegularizerCalculating the exact Wasserstein distance is computationally expensive. The Sinkhorn divergence, Sϵ​, is a computationally efficient, differentiable proxy that is well-suited for use as a loss term in deep learning.40 A temporal regularization term based on OT can be formulated by summing the Sinkhorn divergence between the predicted distributions at adjacent timesteps:LOT​=λOT​t=2∑H​Sϵ​(P(⋅∣θt​),P(⋅∣θt−1​))This loss term directly discourages the model from predicting radical changes in the distribution's shape from one step to the next, as such changes would incur a high "transport cost." For the SBP distribution, this is particularly useful, as it would penalize scenarios where heavy tails (ξ>0) appear or disappear abruptly, or where the central mass of the distribution shifts dramatically without a smooth transition. This enforces a plausible evolution of the entire probability density, not just a single parameter.40Proximal Spectrum Wasserstein (PSW) DiscrepancyMore advanced OT-based techniques have been developed specifically for comparing sets of time series. The Proximal Spectrum Wasserstein (PSW) discrepancy, for example, operates by first transforming the time series into the frequency domain and then calculating a pairwise spectral distance.41 While originally proposed for imputation, this concept can be adapted for regularization. A regularizer based on the PSW could be applied to the sequence of parameters (ξ1​,...,ξH​) itself. By penalizing discrepancies in the frequency domain, such a regularizer would directly suppress high-frequency oscillations in the parameter trajectory, enforcing smoothness from a spectral perspective.3.3. Analogous Techniques from Video GenerationThe problem of generating a temporally coherent sequence of distribution parameters is highly analogous to the challenge of generating a sequence of video frames that are free from flickering and exhibit smooth, realistic motion. The field of video generation has developed a rich set of techniques for enforcing temporal consistency, which can serve as a source of inspiration for novel regularizers in forecasting.43Recent work has shown that adding temporal regularization terms during the denoising process of a video diffusion model significantly improves motion smoothness and reduces artifacts like flickering and jittering.43 These methods work by adding a loss that constrains the evolution of adjacent frames, for example, by penalizing large differences between them after the noise prediction step.45This concept can be adapted to the parameter trajectory problem. We can think of the probability density function (PDF) of the predicted distribution at each timestep, p(y∣θt​), as an "image" or "frame." A regularization term could then be designed to enforce smoothness on this sequence of PDFs:PDF Difference Penalty: A simple approach would be to penalize the L2​ distance between the PDFs of adjacent timesteps, evaluated over a grid of points:LPDF​=λPDF​t=2∑H​∫(p(y∣θt​)−p(y∣θt−1​))2dyThis integral can be approximated via numerical quadrature or Monte Carlo sampling.3D Point Regularization Analogy: Some video generation models regularize the 3D shape and motion of objects to prevent non-physical deformations.44 An analogous approach for distributions would be to track the evolution of key statistical moments (e.g., mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) derived from the parameters θt​. We can treat this vector of moments as the "shape" of the distribution and apply a jerk or difference penalty to its trajectory to ensure it evolves smoothly over the forecast horizon. This provides a more holistic regularization than penalizing a single parameter like ξ in isolation.Section 4: Implementation Guide and Code RepositoriesTranslating the architectural and regularization concepts discussed into practice requires leveraging the appropriate deep learning frameworks and libraries. This section provides a guide to relevant tools and repositories within the PyTorch and JAX ecosystems, culminating in a proposed implementation strategy.4.1. PyTorch EcosystemPyTorch is a mature and widely adopted framework with a rich ecosystem of libraries for time series forecasting and probabilistic modeling.pytorch-forecastingThis high-level library provides implementations of several state-of-the-art forecasting models, including the non-autoregressive N-HiTS and the powerful Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).48Functionality: The library abstracts away much of the data processing and training boilerplate, allowing users to focus on model design.49 It includes a flexible BaseModel class that can be extended for custom architectures and loss functions.50 Models like N-HiTS incorporate mechanisms such as pooling and interpolation that implicitly promote forecast smoothness.50Customization: While the library does not have built-in support for the advanced regularizers discussed, its modular design makes it straightforward to add them. The standard loss for probabilistic forecasting is typically QuantileLoss for quantile-based predictions or a specific DistributionLoss (e.g., NormalDistributionLoss) for parametric predictions.48 A custom composite loss, such as LNLL​+Ljerk​, can be implemented and passed to the model during training.Code Repositories:Official Repository: github.com/sktime/pytorch-forecasting 49TFT Implementation Example: github.com/mounalab/Temporal-fusion-transformer_Pytorch-Forecasting 53Diffusion Model ImplementationsThe field of diffusion models for time series is rapidly evolving. While there is no single canonical library, the community has produced numerous implementations.Key Repositories: The Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model repository serves as an excellent curated list, providing links to papers and official code for many recent models, including various non-autoregressive approaches.54TimeDiff: The original paper describes the architecture and conditioning mechanisms in detail, but there are several unaffiliated public repositories with the name "TimeDiff" that implement different functionalities.27 A careful implementation would need to focus on correctly building the "Future Mixup" and "Autoregressive Initialization" modules as described in the paper.27Optimal Transport LibrariesFor implementing OT-based regularizers, several mature libraries are available.PythonOT (POT): This is the standard library for Optimal Transport in Python. It provides a comprehensive suite of solvers, including efficient Sinkhorn algorithms, and integrates with PyTorch, NumPy, and other frameworks.58GeomLoss: This library is specifically designed for geometric and OT-based losses in machine learning. It offers GPU-accelerated, PyTorch-native implementations of Sinkhorn divergences, making it highly efficient for use as a regularization term.4.2. JAX EcosystemJAX is gaining traction in the research community for its functional programming paradigm and powerful composable transformations (jit, vmap, grad), which are ideal for building custom and highly efficient ML models.Probabilistic Programming and ForecastingThe JAX ecosystem for probabilistic modeling is robust and growing.Libraries: dynamax provides tools for probabilistic state-space models 60, and sts-jax builds upon it for structural time series modeling.61 For general-purpose probabilistic programming, NumPyro and Oryx are powerful choices.62Code Repositories: The awesome-jax list is the primary resource for discovering libraries and projects.63 The jaxer repository offers a clean implementation of a Transformer in Flax, which can serve as an excellent starting point for building an encoder for a forecasting model.64Optimal Transport in JAXott-jax: This library, developed by Google, is the definitive choice for OT in JAX. It is designed from the ground up to leverage JAX's features, providing hardware-accelerated, JIT-compilable, and auto-differentiable OT solvers. Its efficiency makes it ideal for implementing an OT-based regularizer within a JAX-based forecasting model.654.3. A Proposed Implementation Strategy (PyTorch)A practical path to implementing a model that addresses the core challenge would involve the following steps within the PyTorch framework:Encoder Architecture: Begin with a standard, powerful non-autoregressive encoder. A Transformer-based architecture, similar to that used in the Temporal Fusion Transformer 66 or a simpler variant, is a strong choice for capturing complex dependencies from the input context (historical data, covariates). The encoder's final output should be a fixed-size context vector, C.Parameter Head: Implement a custom torch.nn.Module to act as the parameter head. A TCN-based head is a recommended starting point due to its balance of performance and efficiency. This module will take the context vector C, expanded to the length of the forecast horizon H, as input and produce an output tensor of shape (batch_size, H, num_params).Distribution Layer: The output tensor from the parameter head must be mapped to the parameters of the Spliced Binned-Pareto distribution for each of the H timesteps. This involves splitting the last dimension of the tensor and applying appropriate activation functions (e.g., Softmax for bin probabilities, no activation or a softplus for scale β, no activation for shape ξ).Composite Loss Function: Create a custom loss function that combines the primary objective with the desired regularization terms.Primary Loss (NLL): Implement the negative log-likelihood of the SBP distribution. This will require writing a PyTorch function for the SBP's probability density function (PDF) or cumulative density function (CDF), based on the mathematical formulation in.5Jerk Regularizer: Implement the jerk penalty as described in Section 3.1. This involves applying 1D convolutions or using tensor shifts (torch.roll) to compute the finite differences of the predicted ξ sequences. This term should be weighted by a tunable hyperparameter, λjerk​.OT Regularizer: Using a library like GeomLoss or PythonOT, compute the Sinkhorn divergence between the predicted distributions at adjacent timesteps, P(⋅∣θt​) and P(⋅∣θt−1​). This can be done by drawing samples from each distribution and calculating the OT distance between these empirical samples. This term should be weighted by another hyperparameter, λOT​.Training Loop: In the training step, compute the total loss, Ltotal​=LNLL​+λjerk​Ljerk​+λOT​LOT​, and perform backpropagation. The regularization weights, λjerk​ and λOT​, are critical hyperparameters that must be tuned (e.g., via grid search or Bayesian optimization) to find the optimal balance between predictive accuracy on a validation set and the qualitative smoothness of the generated parameter trajectories.Section 5: Conclusions and Future Research DirectionsThe challenge of ensuring temporal coherence in the parameter outputs of non-autoregressive probabilistic forecasting models is a critical hurdle to their widespread adoption in risk-sensitive applications. Naive regularization techniques, such as simple difference or magnitude penalties, are fundamentally inadequate; they either introduce unrealistic artifacts or unduly constrain the model's ability to capture the complex dynamics, particularly in the tails of the distribution.This report has systematically analyzed the problem and surveyed the state-of-the-art solutions as of 2025, categorizing them into two complementary domains: architectural patterns and advanced regularization techniques.Key Findings and Recommendations:Architectural Solutions Provide Principled Priors: Embedding temporal consistency directly into the model architecture is the most robust approach.For applications where the underlying dynamics are known to be continuous, Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) offer the most principled solution. They guarantee continuous and smooth latent trajectories from which distribution parameters can be decoded, providing a powerful inductive bias.For a practical balance of performance and implementation simplicity, hybrid models using a non-autoregressive encoder followed by a sequential parameter head are highly effective. A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) head is particularly promising, offering parallelizable computation and a large receptive field that implicitly encourages smoothness.Diffusion models, conditioned with time-series-specific mechanisms like those in TimeDiff, represent the frontier in generative quality but come with the cost of slow, iterative inference.Advanced Regularization Imposes Meaningful Constraints: Loss-based regularization offers a flexible, architecture-agnostic method for shaping parameter trajectories.Physics-informed penalties, particularly the jerk penalty, are highly effective at eliminating the unrealistic artifacts produced by simpler difference penalties. By penalizing changes in the trajectory's curvature, they enforce a more physically plausible notion of smoothness.Optimal Transport (OT) losses, such as those based on the Sinkhorn divergence, provide a powerful tool for enforcing distributional consistency over time. By penalizing the "work" required for the probability mass to evolve from one timestep to the next, they encourage a smooth and logical progression of the entire predictive distribution.Future Research Directions:The synthesis of these findings points toward several promising avenues for future research:Hybrid Models and Regularizers: The most powerful solutions will likely arise from combining the strengths of different approaches. For example, an NCDE-based architecture could be further enhanced with an OT-based regularizer to ensure that the guaranteed-continuous latent path also translates to a distributionally efficient one.Learned Regularization: Instead of relying on fixed, hand-crafted regularizers like the jerk penalty, future work could explore learning the regularization function itself. A discriminator network, in a GAN-like setup, could be trained to distinguish between real and generated parameter trajectories, implicitly learning a complex, data-driven smoothness prior.Extending Priors from Other Domains: The analogy to video generation is a rich source of inspiration. Further exploration of techniques like optical flow consistency, when adapted to the space of probability distributions, could yield novel and powerful regularizers.Scalability and Efficiency: As models like NCDEs and diffusion models mature, research into more efficient numerical solvers and faster sampling strategies will be crucial for their deployment in real-time, operational forecasting systems.Ultimately, the goal is to develop models that are not only statistically accurate but also produce forecasts that are interpretable, plausible, and trustworthy to human decision-makers. By moving beyond naive regularization and embracing principled architectural design and domain-informed loss functions, the field of non-autoregressive probabilistic forecasting can achieve this goal, unlocking its full potential for a wide range of critical applications.
